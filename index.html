      <h1>My Javascript</h1>
        <p> my javascript here prompts the user to input their name and then gives them an alert about their weekend. After, there are 3 prompts that ask the user to input yes or no to three questions. Once they answer, they will see an alert that tells the user if they were correct or incorrect.</p>
